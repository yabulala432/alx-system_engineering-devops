## ALX Software Engineering DevOps Track
### Description
At ALX School we do hard things, the goal is not to be a good student rather the key goal is to be a good software Engineer. ALX_africa are on a mission to identify, develop and equip Africaâ€™s next 3 million leaders. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done by Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a software engineering or DevOps project. These projects are part of the ALX Software Engineering year 1 curriculum. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of the Linux Shell, Bash commands, Bash scripting, networking, APIs, and web-stack debugging to more advanced topics.
